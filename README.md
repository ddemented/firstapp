IOS swift war app

Swift app :
I tried to make this app by using the new swift language in xcode 6.

In this simple game, we have the enemy and our deck, when we press deal, we get random cards from each deck, the card having
highest value wins, till we reach 15, when the round is over and the winner is decalared.

This is my first attempt at iOS app development, hope you like it
